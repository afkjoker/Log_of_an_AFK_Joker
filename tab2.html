		<h1>Some Writing</h1>
		<h2>July 3, 14:34 PM EST</h2>
		<p>Before I begin, please note the time this was written.</p>
		<p>Excellent! Due to delays, unfortunately I am unable to post about something
		at this time, because life objects to offer something. However, I will say that,
		though I slept at around 12:30 last night, I awoke at 10 something something and
		<b>did</b> get enough sleep. In case you were wondering. But if you're talking 
		about the night before last night, I'm afraid no comment will be made.</p>

		<h1>Losing the Game<h1>
		<h2>July 3, 12:14 AM EST</h2>
		<p>The most difficult part of losing the game is that it's everywhere. Whenever
		you listen to music, there's a small seperation between the music in general
		and losing the game, because the MOP Talent Show proved that certain songs can 
		result in lyrics very similar to "lose the game". Also, since military time can 
		often relate to 14:34, or 2:34 PM, every second or millisecond or smaller will
		have a direct connection with 1434, therefore we are always losing the game.
		Tell me if you can somehow escape losing the game, because every time I look at
		my computer clock, I lose it!</p>

		<h1>New Update</h1>
		<h2>July 2, 7:41 PM EST</h2>
		<p>I recently started a new novel, and am reconsidering the others. However, I'm
		not exactly deleting them either,  because I'm just combining bits and pieces of
		my other stories together to form a bigger, better one. It's turning out well and 
		is pretty funny, noting that the main character has a defect that restricts their
		thoughts, gives them random hallucinations, is supposedly mute, and is forgetful
		and rants on about a graveyard called Raffeh which is "their home." We'll see 
		what happens, and the link (which you won't be able to access) is posted!!!</p>

		<h1>Questionable Note</h1>
		<h2>July 1, 2024, 9:10 PM EST</h2>
		<p><b>1434</b></p>
		<p>Ha! Gotcha there! (Told you I was a Joker)</p>

		<h1>Huh? Wait, what? Sleep?</h1>
		<h2>July 1, 2024, 9:02 PM EST</h2>
		<p>Lately, I've been wondering whether or not my sleep schedule is healthy for me.
		Sleeping at midnight or 1:00 AM and waking at 10:00 AM or even 11:00, I doubt
		the transition to early schedules and school will be exactly trivial. Meals get
		significantly pushed to 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM, and even 8:00 PM, and the fact that
		my sister has a very consistent sleep schedule from 10:00 PM to 6:00 or 7:00
		complicates things even more when it comes to mealtimes. One person hungry while
		the other just ate, the other hungry and the first full; I think I should really
		start paying attention to the attention <b>sleeeeeeeep</b> requires . . .</p>

    		<h1>Summertime . . . Thoughts</h1>
    		<h2>July 1, 2024, 8:55 PM EST</h2>
    		<p>I have to admit, summer can be nice . . . until the heatwave begins and you're
    		trapped in nothing but hundred degrees Fahrenheit and above. In Pittsburgh, we
    		often have mosquito and insect outbreaks. As far as I know, my record for bites is
    		seventy-two in one month. Granted, I'd spent a little under half my time that month
    		outside, so it wasn't entirely nature's fault. People say calamine lotion helps
    		with itching. I want to say it does, and it sometimes helps with swelling, but the
    		itches <b>never</b> stop until you quit going out. And after the whole month, it
    		still took about a week for the swelling to finally decrease. The sun is also a big
    		con of summer, as I don't exactly approve of sunglasses, and am too lazy to apply
    		sunscreen on a regular daily basis. Wish me luck on escaping heatstroke!!!</p>
