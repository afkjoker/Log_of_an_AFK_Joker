    		<h1>Summertime . . . Thoughts</h1>
    		<h2>July 1, 2024, 8:55 PM EST</h2>
    		<p>I have to admit, summer can be nice . . . until the heatwave begins and you're</p>
    		<p>trapped in nothing but hundred degrees Fahrenheit and above. In Pittsburgh, we</p>
    		<p>often have mosquito and insect outbreaks. As far as I know, my record for bites is</p>
    		<p>seventy-two in one month. Granted, I'd spent a little under half my time that month</p>
    		<p>outside, so it wasn't entirely nature's fault. People say calamine lotion helps</p>
    		<p>with itching. I want to say it does, and it sometimes helps with swelling, but the</p>
    		<p>itches <b>never</b> stop until you quit going out. And after the whole month, it</p>
    		<p>still took about a week for the swelling to finally decrease. The sun is also a big</p>
    		<p>con of summer, as I don't exactly approve of sunglasses, and am too lazy to apply</p>
    		<p>sunscreen on a regular daily basis. Wish me luck on escaping heatstroke!!!</p>

		<h1>Huh? Wait, what? Sleep?</h1>
		<h2>July 1, 2024, 9:02 PM EST</h2>
		<p>Lately, I've been wondering whether or not my sleep schedule is healthy for me.</p>
		<p>Sleeping at midnight or 1:00 AM and waking at 10:00 AM or even 11:00, I doubt</p>
		<p>the transition to early schedules and school will be exactly trivial. Meals get</p>
		<p>significantly pushed to 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM, and even 8:00 PM, and the fact that</p>
		<p>my sister has a very consistent sleep schedule from 10:00 PM to 6:00 or 7:00</p>
		<p>complicates things even more when it comes to mealtimes. One person hungry while</p>
		<p>the other just ate, the other hungry and the first full; I think I should really</p>
		<p>start paying attention to the attention <b>sleeeeeeeep</b> requires . . .</p>
