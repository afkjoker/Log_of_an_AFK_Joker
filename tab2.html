    <h1>Summertime . . . Thoughts</h1>
    <h2>July 1, 2024, 8:55 PM EST</h2>
    <p>I have to admit, summer can be nice . . . until the heatwave begins and you're</p>
    <p>trapped in nothing but hundred degrees Fahrenheit and above. In Pittsburgh, we</p>
    <p>often have mosquito and insect outbreaks. As far as I know, my record for bites is</p>
    <p>seventy-two in one month. Granted, I'd spent a little under half my time that month</p>
    <p>outside, so it wasn't entirely nature's fault. People say calamine lotion helps</p>
    <p>with itching. I want to say it does, and it sometimes helps with swelling, but the</p>
    <p>itches <b>never</b> stop until you quit going out. And after the whole month, it</p>
    <p>still took about a week for the swelling to finally decrease. The sun is also a big</p>
    <p>con of summer, as I don't exactly approve of sunglasses, and am too lazy to apply</p>
    <p>sunscreen on a regular daily basis. Wish me luck on escaping heatstroke!!!</p>
