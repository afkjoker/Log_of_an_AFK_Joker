		<h1>Setup</h1>
		<p>I have a strange way of setting up on my Linux laptop. I split the screen</p>
		<p>into two windows, one with the storage document and the other with the text</p>
		<p>editor I use for reference while working. I shrink both windows according to</p>
		<p>the dimensions that would fit the importance of both open tabs. The tabs I</p>
		<p>put in the windows varies, depending on which tab I want to keep open for the</p>
		<p>entirety of the time. Usually, it's the document itself. I can easily switch</p>
		<p>from writing mainly and scrolling through my reference for information.</p>

		<h1>Planning</h1>
		<p>There are many stages to a novel, and it all begins with a storyline. It's</p>
		<p>excessively hard to write without any idea of what you're doing, or at least</p>
		<p>hard to make it sound decent when you do. Otherwise, your novel ends up like,</p>
		<p>quite literally, a monkey trying to type the works of Shakespeaker blindfolded.</p>

		<h1>Formatting Choices</h1>
		<p>Formatting is not what I'd consider the most vital in a novel, but you want your</p>
		<p>font to be legible, right? I have my preferences on fonts more like <b>this</b> one</p>
		<p>or something called "IM Fell Double Pica", because I like a font that I won't get</p>
		<p>mixed up into reconsidering it in the middle of the first hundred pages.</p>

		<h1>Stamina Problems</h1>
		<p>My biggest challenge in writing a novel is reminding myself that it's the best</p>
		<p>thing to write about. From reading random books, I pluck bits of inspiration</p>
		<p>here and bits of inspiration there, but I never seem to get the concept I'm finally</p>
		<p>satisfied with. I'm also lazy, and when it comes to stamina and patience, I lose it.</p>

		<h1>Closing</h1>
		<p>Your conclusion, last chapter, and epilogue are really difficult to cope with, mostly</p>
		<p>because it's nice to end with a cliffhanger or something ecstatic like that. It's</p>
		<p>similar to how you want a hook at the beginning, but it's the end, and better since</p>
		<p>you have more information about the entire novel. Still, in the middle of the book, I</p>
		<p>tend to burn out, which is annoying.</p>
