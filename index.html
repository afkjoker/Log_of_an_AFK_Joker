		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>An individual obsessed with mathematics, literature, and cheese. . .</p>
		<p>. . . and yes, definitely breathing. . .</p>
		<h1>What an AFK Joker Does All Day</h1>
		<h2>(funnily enough, an AFK joker is not AFK)</h2>
		<p>Due to summertime, my daily schedule is:</p>
		<p>Wake up (obviously)</p>
		<p>Eat breakfast (or maybe not)</p>
		<p>Linger on AMC 10 problems with my sister</p>
		<p>Run over and start spamming people on Discord</p>
		<p>Cook on writing (novels) for an hour or two</p>
		<p>Eat lunch (or maybe not)</p>
		<p>Either read or continue to bash my keyboard on Docs</p>
		<p>Exercise (either swimming, cycling, or doing push-ups and sit-ups in the game room with my brother)</p>
		<p>Eat dinner (or maybe not)</p>
		<p>The rest of the evening is a randomized schedule of no specific reasoning</p>
		<p>(AFK Jokers are less interesting than you thought, right?)</p>
		<h1>Current Math Problems</h1>
		<h2>I find several of the problems I do quite intriguing. For example, here's one!</h2>
		<p>A bug travels from A to B along the segments in the hexagonal lattice pictured above.</p> 
		<p>The segments marked with an arrow can be traveled only in the direction of the arrow, and</p> 
		<p>the bug never travels the same segment more than once. How many different paths are there?</p>

		<p>To solve this, we can split the diagram into 5 sectors, knowing that each arrow not filled</p>
		<p>in is "restricted" in a way. I drew vertical partitions along the arrow verticals that were</p>
		<p>only filled, and found the path possibilities for each section in turn. After connecting each</p>
		<p>sector based on the answers I recieved, the problem resulted in an answer of 2400. This one</p>
		<p>was <b>strangely</b> similar to a programming question . . .</p>
		<h1>Current Projects</h1>
		<h2>These are the novels I've been working on recently.</h2>
