			Log of an AFK Joker

		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>An individual obsessed with mathematics, literature, and cheese. . .</p>
		<p>. . . and yes, definitely breathing. . .</p>
		<h1>What an AFK Joker Does All Day</h1>
		<h2>(funnily enough, an AFK joker is not AFK)</h2>
		<p>Due to summertime, my daily schedule is:</p>
		<p>Wake up (obviously)</p>
		<p>Eat breakfast (or maybe not)</p>
		<p>Linger on AMC 10 problems with my sister</p>
		<p>Run over and start spamming people on Discord</p>
		<p>Cook on writing (novels) for an hour or two</p>
		<p>Eat lunch (or maybe not)</p>
		<p>Either read or continue to bash my keyboard on Docs</p>
		<p>Exercise (either swimming, cycling, or doing push-ups and sit-ups in the game room with my brother)</p>
		<p>Eat dinner (or maybe not)</p>
		<p>The rest of the evening is a randomized schedule of no specific reasoning</p>
		<p>(AFK Jokers are less interesting than you thought, right?)</p>
		<h1>Current Math Problems</h1>
		<p>I find several of the problems I do quite intriguing. For example, here's a few.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<img src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/c/2/3c208832b26b520d3585031acd75a37563652720.png" alt="2012 AMC 10B #25 Diagram">
		<p>A bug travels from $A$ to $B$ along the segments in the hexagonal lattice pictured above.</p> 
		<p>The segments marked with an arrow can be traveled only in the direction of the arrow, and</p> 
		<p>the bug never travels the same segment more than once. How many different paths are there?</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>To solve this, we can split the diagram into 5 sectors, knowing that each arrow $not$ filled</p>
		<p>in is "restricted" in a way. </p>
