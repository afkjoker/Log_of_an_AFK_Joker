		<p>in case you were wondering, i'm a geo main</p>

		<h1>2012 AMC 10B #25</h1>
		
		<p>A bug travels from A to B along the segments in the hexagonal lattice pictured above.</p> 
		<p>The segments marked with an arrow can be traveled only in the direction of the arrow, and</p> 
		<p>the bug never travels the same segment more than once. How many different paths are there?</p>

		<p>To solve this, we can split the diagram into 5 sectors, knowing that each arrow not filled</p>
		<p>in is "restricted" in a way. I drew vertical partitions along the arrow verticals that were</p>
		<p>only filled, and found the path possibilities for each section in turn. After connecting each</p>
		<p>sector based on the answers I recieved, the problem resulted in an answer of 2400. This one</p>
		<p>was <b>strangely</b> similar to a programming question . . .</p>

		<h1>2011 AMC 10B #24-#25</h1>
		<p>Though I can't seem to get the file onto the page, these two questions were very interesting,</p>
		<p>#24 being about rays on the Cartesian plane, #25 being about triangle sequences, each triangle</p>
		<p>a step down with side lengths at the tangent points of the triangle to its incircle . . .</p>

		<h1>2011 AMC 10B #22</h1>
		<p>A pyramid has a square base with sides of length 1 and has lateral faces that are equilateral</p>
		<p>triangles. A cube is placed within the pyramid so that one face is on the base of the pyramid</p>
		<p>and its opposite face has all its edges on the faces of the pyramid. What's the cube volume?</p>
		<p>This was interesting. 3-dimensional geo is fascinating to visualize. It took many steps to</p>
		<p>end up with simple Pythagorean Theorems, but in the end, the answer was determined.</p>
